# AML-Predictive-Modeling-Python
Python analysis and predictive modeling for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance.
Instacart Basket Analysis (Python)
Project Overview
In this project, I acted as a Data Analyst for the marketing department of Instacart, an online grocery store that operates via an app. My objective was to perform an initial exploratory analysis of their sales data to uncover patterns and suggest strategies for better customer segmentation.

Key Objectives
The Instacart management team wanted to answer several critical business questions:

What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day for orders?

At what times do people spend the most money? 

How can we simplify price range groupings to aid marketing efforts?

Which departments see the highest frequency of product orders?

What is the distribution of users based on brand loyalty, ordering habits, and region? 

Technical Skills Demonstrated
This analysis was conducted entirely in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Key steps included:


Data Wrangling: Merging massive datasets (over 30 million rows) and handling inconsistent data formats.


Data Cleaning: Performing consistency checks to identify and resolve missing values and duplicate records.


Deriving Variables: Creating custom flags (Loyalty, Spending, and Frequency) to categorize customers based on behavioral patterns. 


Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create charts that explain complex trends to stakeholders. 

Folder Structure
Following industry standards, the repository is organized as follows: 

01 Project Management: Contains the project brief.


02 Data: (Note: Original large datasets are excluded for space; contains cleaned data samples). 


03 Scripts: Numbered Jupyter Notebooks containing the full analysis code. 


04 Analysis: Exported visualizations and the final Excel report for the management team.
